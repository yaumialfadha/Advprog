Exercise 3: Adapter Pattern
===========================

CSCM602023 - Advanced Programming (Pemrograman Lanjut) @ Faculty of
Computer Science Universitas Indonesia, Even Semester 2016/2017

* * *

Your task in this exercise is to complete an implementation of 
Adapter pattern. You are given a program template that will 
produce a page of text whose output depends on the given Renderer 
type. Some parts of the program are left blank and need to be 
implemented.

For extra credits in this exercise, you are asked to implement a 
writer and adapter for a different text format called Markdown. It 
is the text format that is used to write this document.

Starting from this week's exercise, the code template also provides 
a unit test suite that can be executed to ensure your code is 
working matches with the solution. To execute the unit test suite, 
run: `python -m unittest tests/test_week3.py` in your command prompt.
